                <p>Can AI Replace Your Job?</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 2020-21, the IT industry was booming, hiring many people even without prior experience. But
                    today, things have changed. Companies seek smart developers who can fix code generated by tools like
                    ChatGPT. As a result, some are letting go of employees.

                    For instance, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees in January 2023. Google reported 240,000 job cuts
                    in December 2023, indicating a 50% increase since 2022. On average, around 555 people have lost jobs
                    daily over the past two years.
                    <br><br>
                    Will jobs really vanish?
                    <br><br>
                    It depends on your skills. If you understand how AI works and can use it to grow, fix problems, and
                    complement human tasks, your position is secure. But if your role relies solely on AI, like
                    developers or engineers dependent on automated tools, your job could be at risk.
                    <br><br>
                    This shift isn't limited to ITâ€”industries like automotive are using AI for cost-cutting and tasks
                    like driver assistance and monitoring, potentially displacing line workers.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    Many worry about AI replacing human jobs, but tools like ChatGPT, available for a few months,
                    haven't directly caused job losses.
                    <br><br>
                    Enter "Q," an AI developed by Sam Altman. It promises human-like thinking and predictions,
                    foreseeing actions based on past behavior, posing potential challenges for employment. Learning to
                    wield these AI capabilities might secure your spot in companies seeking AI-savvy individuals.
                    <br><br>
                    Understanding and mastering AI's powers might just be the ticket to staying relevant and sought
                    after in the evolving job market.
